# AU_Workshop

Material for the workshop "Image Analysis" (American University, March 2024)

## Brief description
In this class/workshop we will go over the foundations and techniques for analyzing and extracting content from images. We will cover some "image basics", detail the steps necessary to create a Document-Feature matrix for images (รก la DTM, for texts), review the structure and implementation of a CNN.

## A to-do list while following the class
We will use the a Google Colab machine that has some code and material pre-loaded.
Please follow these steps:

1. Create a Google Drive account
2. Create a Google Colab account with the same e-mail as your Google Drive
3. Copy to your drive the folder "blm_images" from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VxxBq5IBbBfVHIouEdwrRfOHnKs3aVet?usp=share_link). Make sure the folder is still called that way.
4. Copy to your drive the folder "CVClass" from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ss271e6xX4DqZOpLk5zrgE_yg0Fn7vvn?usp=sharing).
5. Make sure you have R installed in the personal computer you will bring to class.
6. Please install the stm package in R.
7. Install the rhdf5 package in R. It has to be through Bioconductor and it takes some time. Check this [link](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rhdf5.html) for more information.
8. Download the Functions2ProcessIVW.R file to your computer and remember its location. You can find it in this GitHub site.
